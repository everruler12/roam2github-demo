            - Style your blocks based on the tags you put in them
                - Before::
                    - To make the text in a block blue and hide the tag, you would have to tag a block with #blue and set rules like below in roam/css:
`.rm-block[data-page-links*="blue"] > .rm-block__self {
    color: blue;
}
.rm-block[data-page-links*="blue"] .rm-page-ref--tag[data-tag*="blue"] {
    display: none;
}`
                - After::
                    - Now if you put a period at the beginning of the tag name, like `#.blue` Roam will parse it as a CSS class name, hide the tag within the block ((which you can still hover over to see)) and allow you define a class like so:
`.blue {
    color: blue;
}`
                - This also allows you to make use of the classes we use already from [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/docs) and any we've defined in our stylesheets
                - Demo::

            -  The Open/Close State of blocks is no longer shared across embeds and the sidebar
                - Example::
                    - A
                        - B
                            - C
                    - Before this change
                        -  if you closed A (or "B") in this Embed - it would also close the original block at "A" - and vice versa (closing original would close the embed)
                            - {{[[embed]]: ((xRNnLDbci))}}
                    - After the change
                        - The Embed starts with the same Open/Close state as what it is embedding, but afterwords manages itself independently
                    - The same difference is true in the Sidebar
                        - Shift-click on the dot on any bullet point - and you will see that you can open and close the nested blocks without affecting main view.

            - [[Block References]]
                - You can now replace block-references with text, embed, alias or with text + alias.  The most important of these is [text and alias](((7Zv5Vm1fO)))
                    - Example::
                        - from [[Beating the Averages]]
                            - This is a block ref
                                - "In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup calledÂ [Viaweb](http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release184.html). Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores. What was novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface."
                                    - It is a window onto a block from somewhere else in your Roam Graph - changes to that block will be reflected here as well.

                            - If you choose `embed` you will get this
                                - {{embed: ((0EEP-FcAj))}}
                                    - This essentially gives you a portal to the original source material - if you edit text within the embed - it will change all the references
                            - If you replace with text you will see this
                                - In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup calledÂ [Viaweb](http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release184.html). Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores. What was novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface.
                                    - It is the same as copy-pasting the original text - there is no longer any connection between the text and the new block
                            - If you choose `alias` you will see this
                                - [*](((0EEP-FcAj)))
                                    - This gives you a link to the original item - but in a hyperlinked alias
                                        - The format for aliases is `[alias](((blockid))``)`
                                            - We default to having the alias as the `*` footnote symbol, but you can edit this however you feel
                                        - This is useful if you want to point to multiple ideas, but refer to them with another phrasing - like [Premise 1](((0EEP-FcAj))) and [Premise 2](((-FdvpO3U0)))
                                            - you will see that if you hover over an alias you can see the text of the block you are pointing to as a preview
                            - If you choose to replace with [[text and alias]] you will get this:
                                - In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup calledÂ [Viaweb](http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release184.html).

[*](((0EEP-FcAj)))
                                    - This is useful for drafting - or making a modified version of the original text - you have an alias pointing to the source material - but the text is conveniently there for editing/rewording etc.

                - Inside of the ... at the top right
            - "Prefer full site" option for quick capture
- [[July 2nd, 2020]], [[roam@0.7.0]]
    - [[New Features]]
        - Switch graphs dropdown in the [[left sidebar]]
        - Installing Roam on desktop and mobile is available
            - on chromium browsers
                - on desktop you can install using the three dot menu -> `Install Roam`
                    - chrome extensions are can still be used with the installed version of Roam
                - on mobile you should see a `Install` button next to `Full site` on que quick capture screen
                - the install buttons might not be there the first time you load, they only show up after everything is downloaded in the background and ready to install
                    - just wait a minute or so and then reload the page
            - on safari browsers
                - the `Install Roam` buttons will not appear inside Roam
                - instead you have to add it to your Home Screen
            - on mobile, Quick Capture has a few changes:
                - loads you last graph by default
                - has a graph switcher
                - keeps content when switching graphs
            - on desktop, going to `/#/quick-capture` will also load your last used graph
            - `/#/quick-capture` works as a integration URL on both mobile and desktop
                - it accepts 3 parameters with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding via GET
                    - title
                    - text
                    - url
                - you need to provide at least one parameter, and we recommend that to be `text`
                    - theseÂ threeÂ parametersÂ willÂ beÂ inputÂ intoÂ theÂ boxÂ separatedÂ byÂ newlines
                    - youÂ canÂ stillÂ useÂ newlinesÂ inÂ theirÂ contentÂ regardless
                - parameters must come before hash
                    - e.g.Â `?title=title+one&text=text+two&url=url+three#/quick-capture`
                    - theÂ easiestÂ wayÂ toÂ constructÂ theÂ URLÂ withÂ parametersÂ isÂ byÂ usingÂ theÂ JavaScriptÂ `URL`Â class:
                    - ```clojure
var url = new URL('https://relemma-git-jfb-pwa.roamresearch.now.sh/#/quick-capture');
url.searchParams.set('text', "text here with\nmultiple\nlines");
console.log(url.href); // contains the URL to use```
                - will always show quick capture interface when parameters are provided
            - on Android mobile, you are able to share content to Roam via the `Share` menu, once Roam is installed
                - sharing will open quick capture with the shared content
