- [[Hiring]] [[Work at Roam]] [[Clojure Engineer]] - [[Backend Role]] [[Take Home Project]]
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Given a map, or a [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) database at two points in time
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Generate a diff of the two structures
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Generate the minimal transaction which will bring A -> B, and vice versa.
    - #Bonus 
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Given a set of User-Events which map to certain transactions - find the sequence of user events which brought A -> B, or which would bring B -> A
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Take a roam outline tree, and create a datascript DB with just the data contained within it  - such as this one "This item"
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Publish your code and the demo on a roam graph using `roam/render` and custom components
            - Roam allows you to write arbitrary CLJS code - and evaluate it in your graph - you can use this code - and the roam Alpha API to query your graph, and create mutations for it.
            - Submit your answer as a roam-graph
            - All code should be in the same Roam Graph as the working demo.
            - {{roam/render: ((uP_2barEP)) ((cpgzSMTye))}}
                - ```clojure
(ns starting-point-for-custom-roam
  (:require
   [reagent.core :as r]
   [datascript.core :as d]
   [roam.datascript.reactive :as dr]))

                       :where [_ ?a _]]))]
     [:li (pr-str (keys @(dr/pull '[*] [:block/uid b])))]]]
  )```

        - ## IF you want to also be considered for  #[[UI Engineer]]
            - {{[[TODO]]}}  generate a UI for displaying the diff 
            - {{[[TODO]]}} create a simple component that will let you save the state of a block subtree at various points, and return to these states - by firing new transactions
