- **Keys**
    - title

        - type:: string
    - uid

If the unique identifier conflicts with other uid's in the database or the import, the import will fail. Be careful using this attribute. Standard Roam uid's are 9 characters, but can be any length. Roam uses naniod.js to generate these

        - type:: integer
    - create-email
        - description:: The email of the user who created the object. If not supplied, will be filled in by the edit-email or the user who uploaded the JSON.
        - type:: string
    - edit-time
        - description:: The time the object was last edited, measured in ms since unix epoch. If not supplied, the edit-time of the object will be filled in by either the create-time, or now.
        - type:: integer
    - edit-email
        - description:: The email of the user who last edited the object. If not supplied, will be filled in by the create-email, or the user who uploaded the JSON.
