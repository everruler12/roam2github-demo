- **Sharing Pages**
    One of the most common questions we're asked at Roam is how to share pages from your private graph with your friends, family, or co-workers. In this tutorial we will show you how to do that.
    The first thing you want to do is to open up the page you want to share (note that this will not work with the Daily Notes page)

    Then click on the **... **menu in the top right corner of the window

    Once you have the menu open, click on **Share**

    This launches the following pop-up where you can toggle **Page Permissions** to allow sharing of individual pages (you can also choose to make your whole graph publicly readable and editable if you wish from here)

    Once you have toggled page permissions like shown above, open the same **... **menu and you will see a new option to **Share Page **which you should click

    This opens a pop-up where you can select if you want to have the page be private, publicly accessible but read only, or publicly editable

    Finally, to share the page, all you have to do is copy the link in your address bar and share it with whoever you want!
