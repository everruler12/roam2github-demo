Daily Notes are the backbone of the Roam experience.
When you sign into Roam, you will start on a page with today's date.
We encourage people to start writing on this page because it gives context to your notes.
For example, if you take meeting notes in the Daily Note, the date of your meeting will always be tied to the notes.

Even if you create a new page, it's often helpful to do so from the Daily Note. This way, you'll be able to see when you created these pages, and your work will be visible when reviewing your days.
