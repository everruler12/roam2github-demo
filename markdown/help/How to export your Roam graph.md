One question that we get asked a lot by our users is how to export an entire graph. So we decided we'd make a quick guide on how you can do that easily from any page in Roam.
First, you'll want to click on the **.. Share menu** in the top right of your screen, and within that menu, press **Export All:**

Next, you'll want to choose whether to export in Markdown, JSON or EDN. If you plan on importing this graph into another Roam graph, we suggest you export into JSON to preserve more Roam-specific data so your transition between graphs is more seamless.

Finally, pressing **Export All** will trigger a download of your entire Roam graph in the chosen format:
