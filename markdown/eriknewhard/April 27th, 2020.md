    - 1/5 How can two people look at the same evidence and come to different conclusions?

The only thing that's different between them is their personal experiences, which shape how they view the world.

That's how you can have a celebrity who some people love and some people hate.
    - Fanboys and haters are two sides of the same coin.

One sees no wrong with their object of affection and will go to arms to defend them. The other will try to tear them down no matter what.

Both are trying to feel better about themselves. Neither of them are thinking critically.
    - The people who show hate don't like a part of themselves, and deal with it by projecting that onto others. Their negativity is a better reflection of themselves than their target.

Even while keeping this in mind, it's difficult to not let it get to you.
    - Humans evolved in small tribes where it'd be dangerous to have many people dislike you. You'd get kicked out and left to die.

That's why one hateful comment makes more of an impact on your psyche than ten comments of praise

People might wish to be famous and have a lot of money
    - They think that being a celebrity would solve many of their problems.

But they don't realize what other problems that status brings. One wrong move, death threats and hate mail. It's terrible to be hated by hundreds or thousands of people, no matter how many fans support them.
