        - Love your goals and how you're going about your Zettels. Well done sir!
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] thank you for dropping by and the complements! you motivated me to review [my goals](((9rOs4QMsG))) and remind myself why I’m here (not to mention fix lots of typos :) I am really curious, is there anything in particular you feel I’m doing right with my zettels? sometimes I feel lost in a zettelstorm :D I’m glad to provide inspiration! 🙏🏼
    - #Chat  [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]] I was wondering about the links you place just under the chapter links for the book. Are these pages for concepts you've already been thinking of? Or things that you want to think more about? Please elaborate. Thanks!

        - **Reflection on first reading phase of the book **
            - __I’m about halfway through the book__
            - **What ideas resonate with you from the book**
                - What is the gist of the book? 
                    - I think the gist of the book is that writing can be a natural process (and not sheer willpower) if we use some tried and true methods for collecting our ideas and synthesizing them together
                - that we are creating an idea generator
                - that there is no reason to “summarize” an idea generator
                    - you do your “thinking” in the slip box itself
                - that there is a process for sequencing ideas, assembling into drafts and getting into final form
                - that there is light at the end of the tunnel in regards to how to bring all the ideas I have scattered around together!
            - **Discuss the fleeting note phase**
                - What does the concept of fleeting notes mean to you? 
                    - notes that just come up while reading the text (the first time) - in the moment, stream of consciousness
                - Define a fleeting note in your own words. 
                    - a fleeting note are notes that occur to you as you read the book the first time
                - How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method.
                    - I mostly spent my time highlighting the book (40% through)
                    - I did attempt to rephrase a few paragraphs I highlighted
                        - my biggest block is converting my list of highlights from Kindle and mapping them into text in Roam.
                - What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read? 
                    - I have notes in my own words, not just a bunch of quotes.

        - group sharing around the nature of fleeting notes
            - debate around limited space on flash card slip notes vs the ability to capture **everything** in Roam (and other digital tools)

            - rather than “knowledge” providing “building blocks”
            - editing book in Roam
                - “editing with a sidebar is more efficient”

                    - "Define a literature note in your own words."
                        - a literature note is a careful distillation of your fleeting notes [encapsulating the overall ideas from the author]
                    - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
                        - I found it particularly useful to skim my fleeting notes (and highlights) and capture a set of concepts I thought encapsulated all of them.  I then crafted a sentence or two (or three) that captures all the concepts.
                            - example for chapter 1: "[[getting unstuck]] [[value of adaptive structure]] [[idea process as structure]] [[cost of compartmentalization]] [[transforming GTD]] [[starting from abundance]] [[nature of control]] [[limitations of our brains]]"
                    - "Have you found value in taking literature notes already?"
                        - it forces me to take random notes and highlights that just sit dust and actually **process** them and reword things in **my own words**.  This creates my own insight useful in future dialogue whether it is my own writing or future conversation with someone (or a group)
                    - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
                        - I wouldn’t call it a struggle. I think we’re winging it so I was inventing to process as I went.  In the beginning I was just taking highlights (and adding the occasional note in Kindle), then I tried block highlighting specific paragraphs and making fleeting notes in my own words as I went.  fundamentally I funneled everything into summarizing an entire chapter (at least up to chapter 4 which is how far I got by today)
                    - "Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes."
                        - just seeing relationships of concepts I’ve developed and seeing who else has the same concepts in their sub-graph creates awesome jumping in points for getting to know others in the book club.  seeing other people’s notes around common block references is very insightful, too. I’m excited to see where this goes...

                    - "Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? "
                        - I love the book!  I love books that are not only transformational at a personal level and are also clear at a societal impact level - it’s clear [[Sönke Ahrens]] is out to alter the way we go about writing and help every sift through the noise in today’s deluge of information.  I love the difference he wants to make with students and academics and raise the bar with non-fiction writers.  it just leaves me curious where he feels the traction really is right now (if not with us :)
                    - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
                        - absolutely!  it took a concerted effort to be able to use my own words, rearrange concepts (yet stay true to what he was saying). Forced me to “think” rather than just passively highlight :)
                    - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
                        - while I clearly share this feeling with others - the feeling of “being behind” and it is quite an investment learning the process the first time.  I can tell the way I highlight and write fleeting notes will continue to evolve and it will be great to create the habit of writing a [[Literature Note]] or even permanent notes right off the bat!
                    - "How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?"
                        - I think I might been a tad unrealistic about having the kind of permanent notes in my slipbox to drive assembling a [[Statement of Purpose]] for grad school by 11/29. What does seem realistic is a statement of purpose in the context of the book which I think, in 1500 words, will give a sense of my overall experience with the method, the presentation of the book, what it is doing for my writing and perhaps thoughts on the role I plan to take, personally, to champion what resonates most about this work into my everyday life.  All that said, I reviewed my first draft of my [[Statement of Purpose]] I wrote in the beginning of book club and I’m clear the 2nd draft will be completely different with a different kind of focus.  I think this is in part to witnessing how Sonke writes.
                    - "Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels."
                        - "Explain what a permanent note is in your own words?"
                            - A permanent note takes literature notes away from the source materials. Permanent notes are the meat & bones of one’s slipbox containing arguments to create the kind of discourse that is unique to the person.
                        - "What is holding you back from creating zettels?"
                            - feeling like my [[Literature Note]]s are already complete (when in fact, I’m well aware many of my notes are in the context of the book)
                        - "What are you unsure about? "

    - Process I use to create my literature notes
        - For each chapter (if it was short) or sub-chapter, I reviewed all my fleeting notes and Kindle highlights
            - #[[Question]]  So for now, you are reviewing fleeting notes and then creating literature notes when you are done with __each__ chapter, yes?
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] To be clear, each chapter is a distinct set of literature notes. I discovered my brain needed a break and was taxed if I attempted to do multiple chapters in one sitting (esp a multi-section chapter like 12 comes to mind!)
                - "cramming might not be so hot as exercise aids the learning process (by alleviating stress hormones that flood the brain) #[[Fleeting Notes]]"
            - I am guilty of old habits and did the classic highlight the whole book.
                - ^^Watching others reading books and doing nothing other than underlining some sentences or making unsystematic notes that will end up nowhere will soon be a painful sight.^^ [*](((4hIM0I_l_)))
            - For the next book, I am likely to take on processing fleeting notes __after__ each chapter knowing that there is __some__ value in creating my literature notes in the frame of the entire book (esp if one highlights the whole book in less than a week like I did!) with this in mind:
                - ^^Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later.^^ [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
        - In the spirit of [[designing for retrieval]], I started listing concepts/contexts the literature note I am working on I would like to find later (inspired from my fleeting note/highlight review)
            - "Put some thought into the keywords that index your notes so they can be found in the context of what interests you most. #[[Literature Notes]]"
        - The resultant set of concepts facilitated the summarization process. My goal was find words to connect all the concepts listed (in any order) and produce a concise literature note. [[progressive summarization]]
        - I repeated this process for the next sub-chapter.
            - #Reply-from. [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]] This is great. The concept breadcrumbs at the top almost feel like [[proto-permanent notes]] or seeds. Thanks [[Chinarut]] 🙏
    - Coaching Session summary with [[Beau Haan 📌]]
        - first attempt at writing a permanent note **prior** to session in fact created a tighter version of the same literature note (looking back, in retrospect!)
            - Context decides whether everything or nothing empowers the next step #[[Literature Notes]]
                - "Man’s greatest inventions come from “nothing,” thus we are drawn to draw on a blank canvas or write on a blank page. It is the preparation of notes that externalize our thinking that allows us to go beyond willpower when it comes to writing. #[[Literature Notes]]"
        - My big takeaway is to bring my WHY (ie. [[Goals for Book Club]]) to make my literature notes more relevant to my own interests
            - ^^think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.^^ This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box–it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them? [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))

                - The book has been great!  Book club has been essential in keeping a structure to get the book read quickly, learn to highlight and take fleeting notes with an intent to create literature notes and zettel.  it’s been very insightful to learn how to take material I’ve worded in my own words and project it into a context that is relevant to my interests.
                - it’s been great inventing and envisioning how communication might work in multiplayer mode - this has been a great way to dive head first into Roam and put using the tool into practice (kind the best of “hands on” learning - by just jumping into the deep end :)
            - "Reflect on your Zettel process"
                - still in progress.  happy [[Chinarut/Zettels]] came forth. I’ve got about ~30 Zettels and I think my primary concern is whether I need to worry about the **number** of Zettels because as I learned from my session with Beau, one can create a powerful Zettel out a single paragraph! So I’d want to ask [[Sönke Ahrens]] how to best best deal with dense texts rich with ideas.
            - (reflect on goal for Zettlekasten)
                - aside from [[Goals for Book Club]], I want to be able to synthesize my notes effectively
                - I’m being successful transforming my literature notes into Zettels that are contextualized in my primary research interests which include `collective action` and `wellbeing`

                - "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
                    - I’m writing this after book club and would have to agree with a walkthrough of a [[model slipbox]] in such a way that it does not distract from a novice coming up with something completely novel
                    - what a fully formed Zettel looks like (or at least examples)
                        - maybe a section with a few examples with commentary of the pros & cons of each type
                    - perhaps some guidelines on the number of Zettels - like is it a funnel?  what is an **example** ratio of fleeting to literature to zettel?
                        - how do these numbers adjust depending different styles of thinking and/or writing (or processing!)

                        - how does this work in a transmedia world?
                            - are there certain guidelines or strategies?
                        - what if one is a visual thinker?  more of an artist?
                - "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
                    - the possibilities are endless. I think I was just unclear how to link notes - all notes seem related to other in some form or another.  how do you make the decisions about which zettels to associate with what if we’re trying to suspend our impetus to organize up-front and allow clusters to “emerge” - maybe describe [[emergent clusters]] more fully?
                    - I’m having a hard time considering limitations.  perhaps that it might get in way of just **flowing** with a book or material - that there is something to be said  to not be distracted by taking and processing notes?
                        - perhaps effective strategies for preventing this from happening?
                - "(what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)"
                    - it seems to be working for the context of a [[Statement of Purpose]] and [[graduate school]] and [[wellbeing commons]]

                        - which begs to ask, how many zettels were gathered to write the book just to get a sense of scope?
                        - what does the slipbox for the book we are holding look like?

                    - I will be more selective about highlights that fit this purpose
                    - I will focus on rewording the author’s words in my own words when writing `Literature Notes`
                    - I have a process that breaks down the specific parts of the writing process into manageable pieces
                    - I’ve upgraded my own research process with something very exciting!
                    - I am bringing a method that transforms my relationship to [[graduate school]] and my writing
                        - I feel I don’t need to fear my thesis (not that I feared it, but it feels more palpable now!)
                    - willingness to learn publicly at a whole new level
                        - the experience of having raw development thoughts

    - [[Questions for Sönke]]
        - Your book is wonderfully dense with great ideas (testament to your slipbox!) 🙏🏼
            - Assuming the birth of a slipbox starts with your book (ie. no previous Zettels):
            - What do you feel (just a guess) is the average # of Zettels that should come out of your book assuming the book resonsates highly with the reader?
            - I ask because:
                - I started the process writing `Literature Notes` that summarize **entire chapters** and sections and
                - I was introduced to the experience of being able to derive a very insightful Zettel from focusing on a **single** paragraph in your book (primarily due to the richness of `Fleeting Notes` mirrored back to me by [[Beau Haan 📌]])
                    - "#Zettels [[Passionate people can support each other in the process of recovering from burnout in such a way that it energizes everyone to solve problems that matter to the collective]] z1"
            - Therefore, I feel the range could easily be as few as the number of chapters in your book (**14**) (one could argue **1** for the entire book!) to the number of paragraphs in your book (**hundreds**?) (on the low side assuming 1:1 mapping)

            - "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
                - it’s clear when I choose to, I will take notes with an intent to create `Zettels` - with an intent for my notes to have a “conversation” with them (not not just any old notes)
                - definitely a more bottom-up approach that isn’t as overwhelming as crates and creates of raw fleeting notes
                - knowing the difference between fleeting, literature and permanent notes
                - being mindful of “unanswered questions”
                - being mindful of a “linear argument” to create/derive [from one’s zettel’s]
                - a reminder of the value of learning/writing/thinking publicly, as a group!

                - it’s a lot of deprogramming and rewiring!
                - it feels good and at the same time to resist old habits can feel challenging, not wanting to “change”
                - felt good to focus on **connecting** zettels together rather than the zettels themselves
                    - it was a lot easier to look for gaps in the argument

            - this got resolved by our 2nd call. Fleeting Notes are untethered for the most part and Literature Notes make specific references to the text (via block references in Roam)

I still use the fleeting note section for notes not directly tied to a reference in the book) This way, I only reference the source text once to maintain some level of [[traceability]] between my fleeting and literature notes (which arguably I am using an “archive” model for old fleeting notes rather than “trashing!”)

            - Man’s greatest inventions come from “nothing,” thus we are drawn to draw on a blank canvas or write on a blank page. It is the preparation of notes that externalize our thinking that allows us to go beyond willpower when it comes to writing. #[[Literature Notes]]

                    - If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them.

            - The key to getting unstuck is giving up planning and seeing the creative flow of ideas as our source of control. By implementing an adaptive structure for our writing starting from a place of abundance, we free our brains from using tricks like compartmentalization and embrace creativity at its core. #[[Literature Notes]]

                    - A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 6
                    - As students, researchers and nonfiction writers, we have so much more freedom than others to choose what we want to spend our time on. Still, we often struggle the most with procrastination and motivation.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 6
                    - A good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.

                    - planning will get you through your exams if you stick to them and push through. But it will not make you an expert in the art of learning/writing/note-taking
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 7
                    - Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 7
                    - it is usually the best students who struggle the most.
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 7
                    - it means having fewer ideas to work with, because you know that others have already thought of most of them.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 7
                    - a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 8
                    - Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 8
                    - high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 8
                    - writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 9
                    - Most people try to reduce complexity by separating what they have into smaller stacks, piles or separate folders. They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability and usefulness.

                    - Pink highlight | Page: 11
                    - GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 11
                    - Writing that aims at insight must therefore be organised in a much more open manner.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 11
                    - Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. It wouldn’t make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level. Zooming out to the bigger picture does not really help, either, because then we have next steps like “writing a page.” That does not really help with navigating the things you have to do to write a page, often a whole bunch of other things that can take an hour or a month. One has to navigate mostly by sight. These are probably the reasons why GTD never really caught on in academia,
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 11
                    - What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective.

                    - There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together.
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 12
                    - this is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.

                    - It is the way Luhmann and his slip-box worked together that allowed him to move freely and flexibly between different tasks and levels of thinking.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 18
                    - I wonder how long it will take until the advantages of Luhmann’s slip-box and work routines become equally obvious to everyone.

                        - “Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and **think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests**.”
                        - “develop ideas, arguments and discussions.”
                        - “Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)?”
                        - ”Can you combine ideas to generate something new?”
                        - ”What questions are triggered by them?”
                    - 4. add permanent notes to slip-box - relating new notes. linking new notes. ensuring note is in index or can be navigated from entry points from index

                        - ^^Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters^^ [*](((erCjnBgLf))) #post-lit
                        - ^^Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it. It might be exactly what you were interested in from the beginning, but it is more likely that your interests will have changed–that is what insight does.^^ [*](((erCjnBgLf))) #post-lit
                    - 6. decide on topic to write about - “Your topic is now based on what you have, not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide.”
                    - 7. turn notes into rough draft - be sure to **translate** notes and embed them in the context of one’s argument (while you build argument concurrently)

The goal is to leverage our brain for thinking, not remembering, and maintain a set of permanent notes to give us the freedom to let go (or archive or trash) old notes so the quality of our notes improve over time. This includes old project notes (like todos, drafts, etc) once the project is complete. #[[Literature Notes]]

And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read.

                            - When we extract ideas from the specific context of a text, we deal with ideas that serve a specific purpose in a particular context, support a specific argument, are part of a theory that isn’t ours or written in a language we wouldn’t use.

                            - the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren’t changed. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.

The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it. We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down and translate it into different contexts.

                            - it seems to me this is what the [[study design]] paper I am reading is proposing I do is start with choosing a [[research question]]. (I do acknowledge that it proposes an iterative process and it will be interesting to look back upon this book and resolve debates arguments as to how to best go about choosing a topic for one’s thesis)  I am aligned with what is being proposed here, bottom-up in this context makes so much sense!

                                - clutch!  feeling like you’ve lost purpose or the work that you’re working on has lost purpose or is not inherently what you care about is depressing. [[mental health]]
                                - learning ceases to be fun and perhaps put another way, one ceases to see process from time spent/invested in learning.
                            - ”lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan, 2006; Reeve, 2009).” [*](((hKJOIwEyi)))

                                    - [[Universal Basic Income (UBI)]] would be a step to enable this kind of freedom amongst the most committed of students (of life)

            - [[roots of intention]] [[nature of control]] [[nature of habits]]
                - The root of intention is in who we are being. The moment we feel in control puts a false predictability in the space which is, in fact, not control. Let new habits replace old habits rather than dropping them completely. #[[Literature Notes]]

                        - intentions need to be rooted in who we’re **being**

            - We transform education by giving up the fallacy of top-down organization of curricula and teach students to see writing as a system to synthesize diverse information. We encourage them to build a simple long-term learning structure through writing. When a student sees beyond themselves, they shift their thinking and writing becomes the source of transformation. #[[Literature Notes]]

                    - ^^the long-term, cross-topic organization of notes, which is guided only by one’s own understanding and interest, is very much at odds with the modular, compartmentalised and top-down approach in which the curricula of universities and colleges are organised.^^ [*](((QVfNEbAfL)))

                    - ^^Teaching is still set up for review, and students are not really encouraged to [[independently build a network of connections between heterogeneous information]] – despite the radical change in our understanding on how our memory and learning works.^^ [*](((QVfNEbAfL)))

                        - I did have the insight to know I use sheer willpower to synthesize and that I am burnt out by the way I’ve been doing it. I had the insight to know starting over with a blank piece of paper every time was part of the problem (that is was causing fragmentation). I had the insight to know there was a better way but little did I know I would have the luck to have this book land in my hands!
                    - ^^it would have helped much more if one started earlier – very much like saving for retirement.^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                        - *sigh* I can relate to **feeling** like I haven’t saved up for retirement “early” enough...

                        - yes, it seems absolutely crazy to pick up Zettlekasten when I feel I should just sit in front of a blank page and just write (which we know doesn’t work very well - old habits die hard!)
                    - ^^Change is possible when the solution appears to be simple.^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                        - yes - this seems simple enough indeed!  I am wondering what it will take to learn what are mostly fleeting notes into literature notes...
