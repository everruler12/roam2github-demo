笔记是你所有学习, 研究, 最主要的部分. 市面上教你如何写文章, 但是却忘记了教你如何每天记笔记, [[不积跬步无以至千里]], 没人讨论如何迈笔记的"跬步""
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]  learning 和 studying 的区别?
        - 最后的研究成果论文等等是把过去的积累(过去记录的笔记)汇总写下来.
This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way.  ^^((azi1UHj1T))^^. [*](((baDCUDIxD))) [[why we read this book]]
            - you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward
        - ^^Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. ^^  
这本书会教: 
1. how we organise the everyday writing
2.how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them
[[迈跬步的技巧]] [*](((NOUeE9wbB))) [[why we read this book]]
        - 为什么你会在交稿的期限前异常焦虑. 因为你没有东西可以交. 所以为了解决这个问题, 想当然的就要去谷歌: 如何在 2 天内完成xxx. 但是答案不是这样的, 如果运用 5WHY 法则, 核心问题是为什么你没有稿子交, 但是有的人却可以? 尽管大家每天都做同样的事情: 研究, 探索, 记录笔记, 存稿. 那是哪里出了问题.  这些事情每个人都会做, 这些都没有问题. 问题出在哪? 问题出在反馈上. 当截止日期临近, 产出要汇总的时候才会去回顾笔记, 才能发觉记录的笔记到底有没有用. 完成笔记的这种行为其实会带来一种误导, 让人以为自己在前进 [*](((azi1UHj1T))).  [[why we read this book]]: 教授一种记笔记反馈机制  [*](((1NqxVWlvh)))
        -  ^^If you believe that you have indeed nothing at hand to fill it, you have a very good reason to panic^^. Just having it all in your head is not enough, as getting it down on paper is the hard bit. ^^That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking^^.

^^Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there^^. [*](((VQiKWP6bz)))

                - #quote Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 培养习惯, 不是一蹴而就的, 它不是一个行为, 而是一套仪式. 
                - #quote Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly (cf. Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010).
                - #quote Like every change in behaviour, a change in working habits means going through a phase where you are drawn back to your old ways
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 每天你想培养的习惯都是在对抗那些想把你推回老时光的 phrase
                - #quote Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, just as the fastest car won’t help you much if you don’t have proper roads to drive it on.
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 就像滑雪, 游泳, 只有把每个动作都习惯了, 融入进身体了, 才能获得生产力的提高
            - The principle of [[GTD]] is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water”-the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. The principle is simple but holistic. It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work for you. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds. [*](((ngW0psLUC)))
                - what is [[GTD]]:: 把所有的要做的事情放在同一处, 按照重要性的顺序进行处理. 这让人能看到所有的事情都在把控之中, 这样大脑才不会担心漏了什么事而分心, 使得我们可以专注于眼前桌面上的事情. 
            - why GTD not working for writing:
1. insight cann't be predetermined by definition
2. writing 的每一步并不是线性和能被确定的, 他是一个 flow 流动的过程
[*](((PxFYE_wSD)))
            - #quote There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together.
                - 工具 great 的标准是他们能良好的合作
            -  [[what slip box is]] a system that: 
1. every steps is small
2. keep steps separate enough  to enable us to flexibly do what needs to be done in any given situation
3. the system that you can trust  that  everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.

        - 1.2 The Slip-box::
            - “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 142) #quote
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] slip-box not just a storage, is a person with 智慧
            - “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.) #quote
                - [[why we read this book]]: 这个系统不是让我们突然有 willpower 和兴趣 去做那些困难的东西. 是让我们一直做我们觉得容易 -- 有想法, 有兴趣 -- 的事情, which 这让困难的事情不再困难 , **因我们甚至都不觉得他有困难**.
            - 写作是一个探寻, 讨论和验证的过程. 就像对话. 写作的人都会知道, 我们不可能永远 stick with 第一个念头, 在写的过程中会发展新的念头, 质疑甚至推倒旧的念头, 对某个念头失去兴趣都是时刻可能发生的事情. [[why slipbox]]: 他提供了一个这样的系统, 让人 allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned–which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work. #[[Literature Notes]] [*](((oz882t9yv)))
            - Luhmann was able to focus on the important things right in front of him, pick up quickly where he left off and stay in control of the process because the structure of his work allowed him to do this. 

If we work in an environment that is flexible enough to accommodate our work rhythm, we don’t need to struggle with resistance. 

            - [[why we read this book]]: 提供了这样一个 working environments
#quote Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). 
 [*](((hhTaHBEnz)))
            - 为什么 slip box 在这几十年里面都没有得到广泛传播? 
因为人们对于这样一位著作颇丰的人物, 觉得它的方法一定是特别的, 复杂精美的, 但是现实却只指向了一个 slip box, 这让人难以接受 -- 人们认为伟大的结局一定有一个伟大的开始. 只关注 这个 box本身,  , 却不曾研究它是如何工作的.  [*](((j85ILtzRh)))

                    - contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature
                        - collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read
                    - Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make ^^brief notes ^^about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would **end up in the bibliographic slip-box**. [*](((nN5f1vjN_)))
                        - [*](((55MjPqvfQ))) #[[Literature Notes]]
1. look at the brief notes in the bibliographic slip-box
2. write own ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper
3. keep evch of 2.  idea fit on a single sheet
4. extend a thought to a new note
            - He usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the slip-box. And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious connections.^^ Rarely would a note stay in isolation^^. [*](((zt7lrN7X2)))
                - 
                - keep eye on main slip-box to find connection
                - 以对待最后要发表的文字的态度记录笔记
                - 不让笔记孤立. 在 box 中寻找关联的笔记

如何在 roam 中实现这个方法呢? 如果是 maybe evergreen 是一个好的例子. 或者像这样 {{[[embed]]: ((((Q9re6dNQi))))}}
 [*](((U4Q7m4mQO)))
            - Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them. Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/ or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. This very much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet. But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique. [*](((LAHvoWGna)))
                - [[why we read this book]] on roam. 哪些地方是我没有思考到的, [比如这个, 当他面对几万的笔记时, 如何才能像作者写的这样子进行连接](((42Uv10bBn))), 看别人的笔记, 才发现自己是尽信书. 我没有结合现实在思考这个可能会发生的问题,  所以看完就看完, 没有问题依然没有问题.

            - Now that you know how the slip-box works, you only need to understand how to work with it. And the best way to understand this is to understand a little bit about the way we think, learn and develop ideas. And if I were forced to boil it down to a single bullet point, it would be this: "> We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. ". But first, let me guide you through the process of writing a paper with the slip-box [*](((kVuIQFmCg)))

                - 把困难的部分省略掉, 事情就简单了. 
            - It is the easiest part of all. Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it. All you have to do is to have a pen in your hand while you are doing what you are doing anyway (or a keyboard under your fingers). Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, it helps with it. Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway. ^^If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.^^ Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. ^^“Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,”^^ neuroscientist Neil Levy concludes in the introduction to the Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics, summarizing decades of research. Neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts on thinking have very different ideas about how our brains work, but, as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” (2011, 270) If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write. Richard Feynman stresses it as much as Benjamin Franklin. If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications? [*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))

                - 从 1., 2. 中发掘新的感兴趣的话题, 放入 slip-box.

                - 2. 添加 link 到关联的笔记
                - 3. 把新 note 加到 __start 上或者某个话题的 __start 页面上
            - 5. [[This is what research is]]
                - Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. ^^Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about^^. Take more notes, develop ideas further and see where things will take you. Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises the most insight. Build upon what you have. ^^Even if you don’t have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch–you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered^^. Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. ^^Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it. It might be exactly what you were interested in from the beginning, but it is more likely that your interests will have changed–that is what insight does^^. [*](((erCjnBgLf)))

                - You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about.By doing this, you will elaborate on the meaning, which will make it much more likely that you will remember it.

This warm feeling disappears quickly when we try to explain what we read in our own words in writing. Suddenly, we see the problem. The attempt to rephrase an argument in our own words confronts us without mercy with all the gaps in our understanding.

                - 不要尝试一下就改变过来, 然后 stick with it. 而是在旧习惯中给改变创造机会. Don't don't break the chain, change the chain
            - 如何保证改变后的习惯可以坚持下来或者说能够乐于去一直做改变?
                - 当成为了习惯, 看着别人使用错误的方式做笔记甚至都会让你感觉到不适.
