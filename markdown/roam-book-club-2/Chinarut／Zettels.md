- Welcome to [[Chinarut]]’s idea generator! 🚀 
- 
- short-term goal: [[Statement of Purpose]] (in the context of a [[wellbeing commons]], [[graduate school]], and [[Weave Your Legacy]])
    - Input with special thanks to [[Joel Chan]] 🙏🏼
        - Problem of **synthesizing** diverse lines of evidence --- e.g., primary and secondary research literature, wisdom and religious literature, personal experiences, ideas from others, personal experiments --- ^^to empower individuals to take action towards wellbeing^^
        - Possibility of **sharing** partial starting points for synthesis in a social commons (perhaps a network of personal knowledge graphs or wikis, overlaid on top of various literatures)
        - [[research question]]s
            - what is a commons?
                - “a compelling question that is also very very high level”
            - how is a commons model for wellbeing different from what we have today? [[wellbeing commons]]
            - how do we know what is [[wellbeing knowledge]] and what is not?
            - how will [[ownership of wellbeing information]] be handled? [[ownership of information]]
            - how do we motivate people to take action towards wellbeing? [[motivation to act]]
                - how do we know when actions people take are consistent with [[elevating wellbeing]]?
            - what gets in the way of people taking action towards wellbeing? [[barriers to wellbeing]]
