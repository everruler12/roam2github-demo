            - Ideas that aren't shared have no use, which reminds me of the thesis of #[[Steven Johnson]]'s #[[Books/Where Good Ideas Come From]] [*](((5Bxb_J2dj)))
            - School is different. Pupils are usually not encouraged to follow their own learning paths, question and discuss everything the teacher is teaching and move on to another topic if something does not promise to generate interesting insight. The teacher is there for the pupils to learn. But, as Wilhelm von Humboldt, founder of the Humboldt University of Berlin and brother to the great explorer Alexander von Humboldt, put it, the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter. Everything within the university aims at some kind of publication. A written piece does not necessarily need to be accepted in an international journal to become public. In fact, the vast majority of what is written and discussed is not published in this narrow sense. The review process itself is a form of presenting an idea publicly to the peers and so is everything a student hands over to a professor or lecturer. "Even the handout for a presentation discussed with fellow students is a written piece made public. It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing. The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin" (Peters and Schäfer 2006, 9). If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing. [*](((U0_AKhDHt)))
                - Even the handout for a presentation discussed with fellow students is a written piece made public.

                    - The process of creating truth is a function of exposing an idea to the whims or reality
            - The input of information (e.g., lectures, presentations, articles, podcasts) should is part and parcel of the writing process, for it helps refine. [*](((9LdD6VzxA)))
                - One might ask themselves what the goal is of consuming content. #[[edutainment]] is alright, so long as it's a conscious decision.
                - Open questions merit writing.
                - #[[Zettel: You don't truly grasp an idea until you sing it with your personal cant]]
        - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
            - The holy grail of a good writing system is the creation of ideas that can be easily retrieved and published.[*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
            - There are three types of notes: [*](((qWUhCUP19)))
                - #[[fleeting note]]s, which serve as an external #[[short-term memory]] repository, to be thrown out within a day or two
                    - These, by definition, have no utility unless they're transformed. [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
                - #[[permanent note]]s, which are of highest fidelity, and are repurposed when constructing arguments
                    - These should be of such high fidelity that you can grasp their gist without relying on where you found them. [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
                - #[[project note]]s, which support the movement of a project towards a finish-line
                    - Examples of project-related notes: 
                        - "Project-related notes can be:"
                            - "comments in the manuscript"
                            - "collections of project-related literature"
                            - "outlines"
                            - "snippets of drafts"
                            - "reminders"
                            - "to-do lists"
                            - "and of course the draft itself."
            - Common mistakes:
                - The inability to differentiate between ideas that need to be stored and retrieved (i.e., #[[permanent note]]s) from transient ones (i.e., #[[fleeting note]]s) confounds the importance of what's relevant from what's transient [*](((7GWVsCHA5)))
                    - #[[Question]] How does someone who keeps everything differ from a #[[data hoard]]er?
                - Keeping ideas related only to particular projects prevents the cross-pollination that's required for long-term solution generation. [*](((HlsQj7ZDO)))
                - Hoarding #[[fleeting note]]s, which results in the cacophony of mind [*](((V8bEn02_W)))
            - The output of a good #[[note taking]] system results in the following (not vice-versa): [*](((wIYnbucZC)))
                - More notes results in better utility in your craft 
                - More notes results in the cross-pollination of ideas
                - More notes results in less effort for producing articulate content
            - #[[chapter summary]]
                - There are three types of notes. Each type of note plays a role in the broader picture. Clearly differentiating between the use each serves helps inch closer to the end goal. 
                - The end goal of a #[[note taking]] system is a sense of clarity at the end of a work day, ease of content creation, and cogent arguments, as perceived by consumers. 
        - [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
            - [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
                - Reference to #[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]
                - To produce content means to have already thought about it, and to guide one's practice through qualities like curiosity and passion. 
                    - However, one will benefit from doing so while undertaking the refinement of ideas vis-a-vis #[[permanent note]]s. 
                        - Reading #[[Thomas B.]]'s reflection: (((yayRMd-f9))) 
                            - #[[Reply-from]] [[Art Assoiants]] I too feel like #[[processing]] ideas is work. I also carry that sense of guilt, having at least 5 books in the backburner, filled with #[[fleeting note]]s 
                                - I wonder whether, through engaging with this community, I will resolve some of what i consider to be the processual hiccups that will facilitate the resolution of these experiences
        - [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
            - I remember learning about using external rewards in my first year of university and still marvel, years later, at how irrelevant it is to what keeps me ticking. [*](((RQQ2w8HSU)))
            - Throwback to #[[Book: Atomic Habits]] [*](((ZLooaikXs)))
            - Using this system helps immerse oneself into more frequent cycles of feedback: #[[10000 iterations]] [*](((LoKPUYPOR)))
            - #[[Zettel: You don't truly grasp an idea until you sing it with your personal cant]] [*](((XNIhRfrZU)))
            - There are two meta-tasks in this system [*](((oO7Kd61Qe)))
                - Formulating ideas with ones own language
                - Differentiating and #[[process]]ing notes
    - [[The Six Steps to Successful Writing]]
        - [[Chapter 9. Separate the Interlocking Tasks]]
            - There exist two types of attention: [*](((UHcHGWMNj)))
                - #[[Focused attention]], which is a singular attention given to one thing
                - #[[Sustained attention]], which is a conscious series of redirection towards one particular task
                    - #[[Sustained attention]] has decreased across the population, while #[[Focused attention]] hasn't.
            - Creating an outline is an important and iterative part of the #[[writing]] process [*](((VJrKLYhnV)))
            - #[[quote]] "The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn." [*](((5dE8cfQGo)))
                - Plans are the antithesis to learning.
            - #[[academia]] exists to create knowledge and share it with others #[[paywall]][*](((L4uNlWqv8)))
            - What differentiates an amateur and teacher from an #[[expert]] is that the expert no longer needs to rely on proceduralism [*](((_OQvZf-JV)))
            - Understanding something helps us chunk it into meaningful units for ease of mental processing. Intentionally creating synergies between ideas is facilitated by systems that increase repetitions of exposure and insight [*](((3u90h1h1x)))
            - Environment design as a means of limiting quotidian decisions, thereby reallocating them towards what matters. [*](((GA_-GRwmF)))
                - Writing systems are a way of decreasing decisions [*](((gdS3acyLy)))

- Fleeting Notes:: 
- Weekly Meeting [[November 8th, 2020]] "Breakout Group Number - 1"
    - #[[Note-taking]]
        - #[[Joey Harris]]
            - Two sets of notes - original was #[[Kindle-Highlights]] - was more reading book, this time doing what it says
                - This time - putting text of book in sidebar, personal page in main screen - reading and taking #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - Most notes are random reflections, summaries, etc. Occasionally, chunks or blocks to copy. 
                - Second time around Joey highlighted substantially less than the first round
    - #[[Andy Henson]]
        - When read it back in March, experimented with taking notes in a mind mapping tool
        - Now are much more selective, but rare to highlight without a comment, even if a small line (e.g., "I really like this")
    - The highlight (e.g., in Kindle) is a fleeting note
        - #[[Chris Oakley]] - This book's about being able to take the value out of the book - whatever concept you want to retain, put it into your own words, so you truly understand what it is
            - Related to #[[Richard Feynman]] - you don't really understand an idea unless you can teach it to someone younger; to teach is to truly learn and know
    - #[[Joey Harris]] 
        - Each idea you're writing down should stand on its own
        - You should write it as if you're writing it formally; later, when you need it, it's already written
            - How #[[Niklas Luhmann]] was able to write as much as he did
    - #[[Jack Poole]]
        - Big takeaway - I'm taking notes in the way i'm not supposed to
            - Was realizing... "shouldn't be doing this"
            - Had a hard time implementing the system
        - #[[Joey Harris]] - You don't really learn something unless you do it, put it into practice
        - #[[Andy Henson]] - now realize that not doing it the best way
            - Started using #[[ReadWise]] - readwise forced me to keep going over the same thing
    - #[[Joey Harris]] Everything is a #[[Fleeting Notes]] that moves towards #[[Permanent Note]]s
        - #[[Andy Henson]] struggled between a literature note and a #[[Fleeting Notes]]
    - Confusing - what's the typology of notes?
        - #[[Literature notes]] is context - where did you get the note from; like a citation
            - These turn into #[[fleeting notes]]
                - These turn into #[[Permanent Note]]s
    - #[[Palash]] #[[Literature Notes]] need to be in your own words
        - Everything you have in your brain is a #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - It's partly about being mindful about your own thoughts
            - First, what do I want out of this book - the output of that is what's in the #[[Permanent Notes]]
    - #[[Chris Oakley]] It's about getting things out of your head, and knowing you could come back to them later. It's emptying your mind. 
    - #[[Joey Harris]] It's interesting how #[[Roam Research]] maps onto #[[How To Take Smart Notes]]
- "Graph Meditation #[[Graph Meditation]]"
    - Like immersion into any new #[[culture]], getting used to our shared database requires flexibility, and curiosity
        - When I open a new database, one that i didn't have the role of designing, i feel i'm drinking from a fire hydrant
        - And at the same time, even my own main database feels like a hot mess
        - ^^So maybe it's being presented a mirror to the mind, the psychedelic self-referential moment of awareness of collective consciousness. And that's a bit spooky, yet probably growthful.^^
            - #Chat Snow Crash #book [[Joey Harris]]
                - #Chat Also [[Carl Jung]] of course [[Joey Harris]]
- [[November 15th, 2020]] #[[Live Session 3]]
    - "{{[[DONE]]}} **Section 1 Writing Session**"
        - I still can't tell the difference between a #[[Fleeting Notes]] and a #[[Literature Note]], and that's likely because when i go from original to my notes, i already paraphrase[*](((kHdks4qwM)))
        - Responses
            Same - and i don't expect to pivot to primarily digital any time soon[*](((rDLZ-VUmR)))
